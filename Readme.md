## You are the mad scientist - Frankenstein. 

## Use these tools and build your monster!

## Purpose, 
Originally created as a public facing express api. 

Purpose deviated as a document parser was added to the express render. 

With the presence of a document parser 
<br/>savvy developers could send for particular site's.
1) arrays of inclusion objects 
2) arrays of exclusion objects 

## Deliverable 1, Installation: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MichaelDimmitt/projectFrankenstien.git;
cd projectFrankenstien;
node server.js;
```

## Deliverable 1: (close to complete) html concatenation rendered by express
html parsing concatenated together into a large string and rendered by express. 

Supporting dynamic routing on relative reference websites

```example:
Remember when you learned the magic of viewing page source 
putting it in an html file and opening the website as an exact copy?

If the website had relative referencing you could go no further.
You only had that specific page not the whole website. 

With the dynamic html generation from this javascript project 
you have access to all the things that are publicly available. ðŸ¤”
```

### Deviation 1: (not attempted) via Binary Stream
Accepting and rendering/streaming a binary stream(idea thanks to m_woods97).

Network request response allowing a thin client behavior(request rendered in chunk/stream form)

Instead netowrk request with thick client behavior (awaiting the full request)

### Deviation 2: (not attempted will be in other repo. link coming soon.)
Implementation in elixir hackney with proxy streaming 

Or, build what is called a reverse proxy.

## Deliverable 3: html has js Links with javascript links.
Full react application, or other framework. 

Or multiple javascript links added to the html rendered by express. 

You can add js links before or after parts of the include/exclude object with html id's to be understood and added by the browser after express renders.

## Deliverable 4: Node Package (not attempted)
Implement as an Node Package that people can install in their project to include or exclude specific parts of another website into their project.

## Deliverable 5: Google Chrome/ Firefox plugin (not attempted)
self explanatory
